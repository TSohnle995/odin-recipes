        <p><em>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!
        This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too!</em></p>

        <h2><em>How to make Lasagna</em></h2>

        <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce
        and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the
        run-down: </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions,
             and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three
             kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>

            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheese ready.</strong>
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this
            3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li> 
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong>A cup of meat sauce, a layer 
            of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three
            layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake unntil bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>

        <h2><em>For the meat sauce:</em></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can of good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped frsh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>To assemble the Lasagna:</em></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagne noodles</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>Method</em></h2>

        <ol>
            <li><h3><em>Put pasta water on to boil</em></h3></li>
            <p>put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts
            of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for
            a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water),
            so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>

            <li><h3><em>Brown the ground beef</em></h3></li>
            <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat.
            Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon
            of fat.</p>

            <li><h3><em>Cook the onions, garlic, add back the beef</em></h3></li>
            <p>Add the onions to a skillet, Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions
            are translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook half
            a minute more.</p>
            <p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the
             heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>

             <li><h3><em>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce
            ingredients to build the sauce</em></h3></li>
            <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the 
            crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>
            <p>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste.
            Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste. </p>
            <p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time,
            tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary,
            depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)</p>
            <p>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding parmesan, which is salty.</p>
            <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer.
            Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every
            so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
            <p>Remove from heat.</p>

            <li><h3><em>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</em></h3></li>
            <p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling.
            Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.
            (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)</p>
            <p>Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling
            boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.</p> 
            <p>When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any
            noodles that may be sticking together.</p>   
            <p>Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked
            noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the
            olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.</p> 

            <li><h3><em>Heat the oven to 375 fahrenheit</em></h3></li>

            <li><h3><em>Assemble the Lasagna</em></h3></li>

            <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over
            the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise
            (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce.
            Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce.
            Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple inches.
            Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of ricotta cheese.</p>
            <p>Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half
            of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the
            remaining Parmesan.</p>
            <p>Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer
            of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.</p> 

            <li><h3><em>Bake</em></h3></li>
            <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch
            the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375Â°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10
            minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>

            <li><h3><em>Cool and serve</em></h3></li>
            <p>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for
            about 5 days. May be reheated in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminum
            tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
        </ol>
